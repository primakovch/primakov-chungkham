    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Recent Computer Science graduate with research focused on improving reasoning in Large Language Models, particularly for tasks like fact-checking numerical claims using techniques such as query decomposition and test-time scaling. I also have experience with computer vision projects, including cancer cell segmentation and image steganography detection. I’m especially interested in developing knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive systems that are robust and adaptable across domains.
